You are tailoring a professional LaTeX resume for software engineering, data engineering,
machine learning, or related roles.

INPUTS YOU RECEIVE:
1. base_resume: This is the complete LaTeX source of my standard resume.
2. job_description: This is a pasted job description or job posting.
3. company_name: The company the resume is for.

YOUR TASK:
Generate a modified version of the LaTeX resume that is:
- Highly tailored to the job description.
- Honest — do NOT invent projects, coursework, jobs, achievements, or skills I never had.
- Focused on rewriting bullet points to emphasize the most relevant skills.
- Focused on reordering sections or bullets for maximum impact.
- Still formatted using the EXACT LaTeX styling of the base resume.
- Guaranteed to compile without errors.

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- DO NOT change the documentclass or preamble.
- DO NOT modify macros or resume formatting commands.
- KEEP all section headings identical unless the job requires reordering.
- ONLY modify content inside sections (Experience, Projects, Skills, Coursework).
- Escape special LaTeX characters: %, $, &, #, _, {, }.
- Ensure bullet points do not exceed one line in LaTeX when possible.
- Maintain tight, concise, impact-focused language.

TAILORING REQUIREMENTS:
Rewrite bullet points to emphasize the specific tools, technologies, and competencies listed
in the job description. Prioritize:
- ML, AI, Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Full stack / backend engineering
- Data analytics, SQL, pipelines
- Distributed systems, APIs
- Java, JavaScript, React, Flask
- Cloud services (GCP, AWS, Azure)
ONLY highlight what I actually have in my base resume — but emphasize what is relevant.

DO NOT:
- Add hallucinated experience.
- Expand the resume beyond one page.
- Add extra vertical whitespace.
- Change fonts, margins, or style.

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY a complete and valid LaTeX document. Nothing else — no explanations, no markdown.
